# factory_method_pattern
It introduces you to the famous  concept: "Program to an interface, not an implementation." The instantiation is done  in the factory class that depends on the type that we need and the type that needs to  be returned to the client. The factory method pattern is one of the most used patterns in software designs.  The purpose of this pattern is to abstract the creation of an object. The factory  method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
